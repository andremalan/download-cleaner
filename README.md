download-cleaner
================

Clears out useless files in downloads folder

At the moment just does dmg's and zip files in the downloads folder on my local file system, but I may genericize it soon.

I'm using lingon3 to make it run every night. Just add a new job and paste in the path to the download_cleaner.rb file
